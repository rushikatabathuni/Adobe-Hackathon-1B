    "2": "Model Report:\nAnticipatory Action Trigger for Drought in Niger\n1. Background\nThis document summarizes the documentation and findings developed in the peer review of the\nAnticipatory Action Trigger for Drought in Niger. The trigger mechanism was designed for an\nanticipatory action framework coordinated by OCHA. The goal of the trigger mechanism is to\ndetect increased drought risk in Niger and trigger the release of funds from the Central\nEmergency Response Fund in anticipation of drought-related humanitarian needs. The release\nof funds can be triggered from six months ahead of the rainy season (which runs from July\nthrough September) until one month into the season. The trigger mechanism includes a\npredictive model that uses seasonal precipitation forecasts and an observational model that\nuses the Standardized Precipitation Index.\nThe review was conducted between May 2022 and January 2023.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nThe documentation describing the model and its application, as well as the outcomes of the\nreview process, are available through the following links:\n\u25cf\nThe Model Card describes version 1 of the trigger mechanism. It was completed by\nOCHA in June 2022 and updated in October 2022.\n\u25cf\nThe Model Evaluation Matrix presents the outcomes of the technical review and was\ncompleted by Mohammad Shamsudduha, Associate Professor in Humanitarian Science\nat the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London, in December\n2022.\n\u25cf\nThe Implementation Plan summarizes the concrete actions that the trigger mechanism\nwill inform and was developed by OCHA in October 2022.\n\u25cf\nThe Ethical Matrix identifies issues that may come up in the implementation of the\ntrigger mechanism and stakeholders that may be impacted by those issues. The Ethical\nMatrix was completed in January 2023 by Andrea Romaoli Garcia, ITU Topic Driver on\nOpen Code.\nThe sections below provide a summary of the main findings and recommendations developed in\nthe review.\n",
    "3": "2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n\u25cf\nThe intended use of the predictive model is appropriate.\n\u25cf\nThe model may not detect localized rainfall shortages, which could lead to the model\nmissing a trigger where it should detect increased drought risk. In addition, crop failure\ndepends on a number of factors other than rainfall, including the use and availability of\ngroundwater for irrigation as well as changes in temperature. The fact that these\nadditional factors are not included in the model should be considered in the\ninterpretation of model outputs.\nModel Development and Documentation\n\u25cf\nThe resolution of the spatial coverage of the predictive model is very high at 0.05\ndegrees. The predictive model produces outputs on a monthly basis. The geographic\nscope of the predictive model includes the entire country of Niger. These parameters are\nappropriate for a national-scale model.\n\u25cf\nThe spatial resolution of the predictive model at 0.05 degrees is too high given that the\npredictive model is primarily dependent on precipitation variability. Correlation between\nforecasts and observational rainfall data produced by CHIRPS is weak in Maradi and\nNiamey regions, where the irrigation is the highest in the country.\nModel Evaluation\n\u25cf\nThe predictive model is evaluated using accuracy, hit rate, miss rate, false positives and\nfalse negatives as parameters. These model evaluation criteria are appropriate for this\npredictive model.\n\u25cf\nA comparison between the predictive model outputs and NextGen forecasts was based\nonly on CHIRPS gridded rainfall data. No detailed information is provided on the\ndownscaling of the forecasts and evaluation of the downscaled technique.\nOperational Readiness\n\u25cf\nActivities and funding are provided on a \u201cno-regrets\u201d basis after a trigger activation.\nActivities and funding are purposefully selected to still be valuable in the absence of a\nshock. The addition of an observational trigger based on SPI is a strength of this\nanticipatory trigger mechanism.\n\u25cf\nThe forecast accuracy could be improved if the predictive model is tailored to individual\nareas within Niger.\n\u25cf\nThere is little mention of local/national capacity building or strengthening in the process.\n\u25cf\nThe performance of the predictive model should be evaluated against the observational\nmodel\noutputs\nto better understand the weaknesses in the predictive model.\nStrengthening the predictive model outputs increases the potential impact of the trigger\nmechanism due to the increased lead time.\n",
    "4": "\u25cf\nThe low or even negative correlation between the predictive model outputs and CHIRPS\nprecipitation in the northern part of Niger should be examined to improve the\nperformance and validity of the predictive model.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nFalse negative activation (non-activation in the presence of a shock)\n\u25cf\nA false negative would deprive the community of timely aid.\n\u25cf\nRecommendation: The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously evaluated\nagainst the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS precipitation data to\nlower the likelihood of false negatives.\nFalse positive activation (activation in the absence of a shock)\n\u25cf\nA false positive would increase the risk of wasted financial resources. Such error could\nundermine the confidence of stakeholders and donors and could lead to discontinuation\nof the trigger mechanism. A false negative primarily impacts other stakeholders,\nincluding local NGOs, the model developers and UN entities, due to the misallocation of\nresources. It also undermines trust in the trigger mechanism.\n\u25cf\nRecommendation: A false positive is more tolerable compared to a false negative, as a\nfalse positive triggers activities and funding that benefit the population even in the\nabsence of a shock. The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously\nevaluated against the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS\nprecipitation data to lower the likelihood of false positives.\nIdentity exposure (exposure of individual identities through potential use of additional data\nsources in implementation of the model)\n\u25cf\nUnauthorized access to any personal data used in future implementation of the trigger\nmechanism could cause harm and carries reputational risk.\n\u25cf\nRecommendation: Given that the trigger mechanism does not include the use of any\npersonal data there is little concern that a data breach could result in re-identification. If\nthe implementation of the trigger mechanism evolves over time to include additional\npersonal data, the tools and infrastructure used in implementation should be\nre-evaluated and adjusted as needed to mitigate the risk of identity exposure.\nBias in available data\n\u25cf\nBias in data availability resulting from gaps in data for different regions in Niger could\naffect the allocation of funding and activities.\n\u25cf\nRecommendation: Determine whether there are gaps resulting in biases in climate data\navailability for Niger in order to prevent unfair allocation of funding and activities.\n",
