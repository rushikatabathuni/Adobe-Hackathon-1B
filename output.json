Digital IDs are usually \npassword protected. They can be stored on your computer in PKCS #12 file format. Digital \nIDs can also be stored on a smart card, hardware token, or in the Windows certificate store. \nRoaming IDs can be stored on a server. Acrobat includes a default signature handler that can \naccess digital IDs from various locations. Register the digital ID in Acrobat for it to be available \nfor use. \n \nStore certificates on directory servers \nDirectory servers are commonly used as centralized repositories of identities within an \norganization. The server acts as an ideal location to store user certificates in enterprises that \nuse certificate encryption. Directory servers let you locate certificates from network servers, \nincluding Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers. After you locate a \ncertificate, you can add it to your list of trusted identities so that you don\u2019t have to look it up \nagain. By developing a storage area for trusted certificates, you or a member of your \nworkgroup can facilitate the use of encryption in the workgroup. \nFor more information about directory servers, see the Digital Signature Guide. \n \nImport directory server settings (Windows only) \nYou import directory server settings using security import/export methodology or a security \nsettings file.

Timestamps are easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted timestamp \nauthority certificate. A timestamp helps to establish when you signed the document and \nreduces the chances of an invalid signature. You can obtain a timestamp from a third-party \ntimestamp authority or the certificate authority that issued your digital ID. \nTimestamps appear in the signature field and in the Signature Properties dialog box. If a \ntimestamp server is configured, the timestamp appears in the Date/Time tab of the Signature \nProperties dialog box. If no timestamp server is configured, the signatures field displays the \nlocal time of the computer at the moment of signing. \nNote: If you did not embed a timestamp when you signed the document, you can add one \nlater to your signature.
